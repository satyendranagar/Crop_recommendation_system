# Crop_recommendation_system
Crop suggestion in agriculture is a latest generation bubble that has captivated
the public's interest. Most farmers are unaware on the sort of crops that should
be planted on their land. This produces a lot of confusion and hinders
productivity. This is why we're working on picking the greatest crop to produce
in order to maximize productivity. The dataset was constructed by gathering
rainfall, climate, and fertilizer data from numerous sources across India. When
numerous geographic and climatic elements are taken into account, we will
have a better grasp of agricultural patterns. This dataset may be used to train a
machine learning model that predicts the best crop to plant in a certain region.
The agriculture industry has the potential to be changed by machine learning.
We can aid producers decide on raw materials and other resources significantly
sooner than they would otherwise by anticipating the perfect crop to cultivate.
This will solve the problem of nutrient inadequacy in fields caused by
inappropriate crop planting, which may influence production efficiency in a
number of ways. India continues to lag behind in finding new solutions for
agriculture, which accounts for over half of the country's GDP. More scientific
solutions must be developed if India's agriculture economy is to hit new
heights.

The aim of the methodology is to recommend the best crop on the basis of certain
parameters like N, P, K, humidity, ph, rainfall. The algorithms used for this were
Random Forest, K Nearest Neighbours, Decision Tree, etc
